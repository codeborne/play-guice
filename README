## Changelog

### 1.10

Move creation of guice injector from `onConfigurationRead()` to `onApplicationStart()`.
We found that method `onConfigurationRead()` can be called many times during application lifetime (on every application.conf change).
It causes creating multiple instances of guice injector, thus causing memory leaks.

### 1.9

  * Added guava 23.0 dependency (Guice actually doesn't work without it)
  * upgrade to play 1.5.1 (which adds methods Injector.setBeanSource() and automatically injects controllers' instances)

### 1.8

  * upgrade to play 1.5

### 1.7

  * create request.controllerInstance even if action method is static

### 1.6

  * upgrade guice to 4.1.0 and include multibindings

### 1.5

  * support injecting of non-static dependencies into controllers

### 1.4

 * upgrade to guice 4.0

### 1.3

 * support both javax.inject.Inject and com.google.inject.Inject annotations
 * first search for custom injectors, and only then - for Modules.  (the previous code depended on order of classes: which of them meets first in classpath)

### 1.2

 * copy of play-guice 1.2 plugin
